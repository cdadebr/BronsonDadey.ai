## Introduction

Need help uploading your Paperspace model to Hugging Face Spaces? This guide will show you how simple it is, with step-by-step instructions for fast.ai students and fast.ai library users.

## Create a Space on Hugging Face Spaces

To create a new Hugging Face Space, click on the 'Spaces' navigation header to access the Spaces homepage. Then, click on the "Create new Space" button highlighted in the image below:

Copy these options and click "Create Space":

Your space is now all set up! It should look something like this:

## Clone the Hugging Face Spaces repository

Head over to your Paperspace tab and click on the `.ipynb` file used to code your model. Use the following `!git` command to clone the repository (be sure to edit in your Hugging Face login details):

Side note: copy and paste everything after `#` in the following code blocks.

```{python}
#!git clone https://"username"/"password"@huggingface.co/spaces/cdadebr/"model_repo"
```

A folder should appear in your Paperspace files directory with the same name as your Hugging Face space:

## Export your Paperspace model

Create a `Path` variable for your cloned repository folder. Use the `.export` method on your `Learner` variable and pass the path for your model as an argument using the `Path` variable. If you're following fast.ai convention, your `Learner` should be named `learn`:

```{python}
#model_path = Path('/notebooks/model_repo')
#learn.export(model_path/'model.pkl')
```

## Create an `app.py` and `requirements.txt` file in your cloned repository

Change the current directory on your Paperspace machine to the Hugging Face cloned repository using the `cd` command, followed by the path to the repository. You can obtain the repository's path by right clicking the folder and selecting 'Copy path'. Use the `!touch` command to create the `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files. Alternatively, you can navigate to the cloned repository in the 'Files' tab and manually create the `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files by clicking on the 'New File' icon and entering the desired file names:

```{python}
#cd /notebooks/model_tutorial
#!touch app.py
#!touch requirements.txt
```

## Modify and add the following code to `app.py`

The following code was adapted from Tanishq Abraham's tutorial "Gradio + Hugging Face Spaces" ([**https://tmabraham.github.io/blog/gradio_hf_spaces_tutorial**](https://tmabraham.github.io/blog/gradio_hf_spaces_tutorial)). Make sure to edit the variables to fit the specifics of your model before pasting it. Credit goes to Tanishq Abraham for the original code.

```{python}
#import gradio as gr
#from fastai.vision.all import *
#import skimage

#def get_y(o): return [parent_label(o)]

#learn = load_learner('model.pkl')

#labels = learn.dls.vocab

#def predict(img):
    #img = PILImage.create(img)
    #pred,pred_idx,probs = learn.predict(img)
    #return {labels[i]: float(probs[i]) for i in range(len(labels))}

#title = "Insert Your Model Title"
#description = "Provide a Description of What Your Model Does"
#interpretation='default'
#enable_queue=True

#gr.Interface(fn=predict,inputs=gr.inputs.Image(shape=(512, 512)),outputs=gr.outputs.Label(num_top_classes=3),title=title,description=description,interpretation=interpretation,enable_queue=enable_queue).launch()
```

## Add the following code to `requirements.txt`

Navigate to `requirements.txt` in the cloned repository and paste the following code:

```{python}
#fastai
#scikit-image
```

## Log into git

Navigate back to your `.ipynb` file and input these `!git` commands (remember to change the email address, username, and password to your specific account details):

```{python}
#!git config --global user.email "email@hotmail.com"
#!git config --global user.name "username"
#!git config --global user.password "password"
```

## Push your Paperspace cloned repository folder to Hugging Face

Before pushing anything to your Hugging Face space, ensure that the current directory you are working from is the cloned repository folder. You can check the current directory by using the `ls` command. If you are in the correct directory, input these `!git` commands to push your Paperspace model to your Hugging Face space:

```{python}
#!git add /notebooks/model_tutorial
#!git commit -m "Add app.py/requirements.txt files"
#!git push
```

And that's it! You'll need to wait a few minutes for Hugging Face to build the Gradio web app but after that, your model should be live on Hugging Face and available for anyone to use!
